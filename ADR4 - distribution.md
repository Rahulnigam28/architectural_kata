# 1. Handling Meal Distribution

## Status
Proposed

## Context
* Distribution
* How does our system get notified of location inventory updates? Upon restocking the kiosk.
* Do we track in-flight inventory (on its way from kitchen to distribution point)? Yes because we want to show customers how many items are in the fridge or kiosk. But with this info, we could show them how soon they might see a resupply.

## Decision
This may not be an ADR.

## Consequences
